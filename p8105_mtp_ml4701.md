### 1 - Data

``` r
# Load and clean variable names
eop_df = read_excel("p8105_mtp_data.xlsx",range = "A9:I1230") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(eop_visibility = eop_visibility_classification) %>% 
  mutate(
    eop_size_mm = str_replace_na(eop_size_mm,"0"), # Filled missing values in eop_size
    
    #data type conversion
    sex = factor(sex),
    sex = recode(sex,"0" = "female", "1" = "male"),
    
    age_group = fct_inseq(age_group,ordered = TRUE),
    eop_size_mm = as.numeric(eop_size_mm),
    eop_size = fct_inseq(eop_size,ordered = TRUE),
    eop_visibility = fct_inseq(factor(eop_visibility),ordered = TRUE),
    eop_shape = factor(eop_shape),
    fhp_category = fct_inseq(fhp_category,ordered = TRUE))
```

The following steps are done to clean and tidy up the data:

1.  Columns names are converted to lower snake case

2.  Missing values in `eop_size_mm` are filled with `0` as indicated in
    the original dataset (Yet missing values in `eop_shape` and
    `fhp_size` are kept as `NA` as no such information provided).

3.  `eop_size_mm` is converted to numeric variable;
    `sex`,`eop_shape`,`age_group`, `eop_size`,`eop_visibility` and
    `fhp_category` are converted to factors.

The resulting dataset has 1221 rows and 9 columns. Based on the original
scientific report,

**key variables:**

-   `sex`: gender of participants, factor with 2 unordered levels
    female, male
-   `age`: age of participants, numeric variable with mean 45.5118755
    and range \[17, 88\]
-   `age_group`: age groups divided according to decades. Has 8
    ascending levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
-   `eop_size_mm`: size of EOP, numeric variable with mean 6.8330549 and
    range \[0, 35.7\].
-   `eop_size`: ordered factor encoded from `eop_size_mm` with 7
    ascending levels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 14.6, where “14.6” seems to be a
    typo in the dataset. *Note: `eop_size` &gt; 1 (`eop_size_mm`&gt; 10)
    were defined as enlarged EOP (EEOP).*
-   `fhp_size_mm`: size of FHP, numeric variable with mean 26.1013416
    and range \[0, 89.3\], has 6 missing values.
-   `fhp_category`: ordered factor encoded from `fhp_size_mm` with 9
    ascending levels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 30.8.

**Other variables:**

-   `eop_visibility`: factor with 3 ordered levels 0, 1, 2
-   `eop_shape`: factor with 4 unordered levels 1, 2, 3, 5, has 522
    missing values

Despite 528 missing values, most of them (522) lie in `eop_shape` and is
not key variables in the paper, so a total of 1221 participants are
included.

The age and gender distribution are displayed with following table and
plot:

``` r
eop_df %>% 
  mutate(age_group = recode(age_group,"1" = "<18","2" = "18-30", "3" = "31-40",
                            "4" = "41-50", "5" = "51-60", "6" = "61-70", 
                            "7" = "71-80", "8" = ">80")) %>% 
  janitor::tabyl(age_group,sex) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| age\_group | female | male |
|:-----------|-------:|-----:|
| &lt;18     |      1 |    1 |
| 18-30      |    151 |  152 |
| 31-40      |    102 |  102 |
| 41-50      |    106 |  101 |
| 51-60      |     99 |  101 |
| 61-70      |     89 |   89 |
| 71-80      |     65 |   61 |
| &gt;80     |      1 |    0 |

``` r
eop_df %>%
  mutate(age_group = recode(age_group,"1" = "<18","2" = "18-30", "3" = "31-40",
                            "4" = "41-50", "5" = "51-60", "6" = "61-70", 
                            "7" = "71-80", "8" = ">80")) %>% 
  group_by(age_group,sex) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group,fill = sex))+
  geom_bar(alpha = .7, position=position_dodge())+
  labs(title = "Gender and age distribution of Participants",
       x = "Age group",
       y = "Number of participants")
```

There’s some internal inconsistency within the dataset.

1.  Definitions of categorical variables was not clearly specified,
    especially the endpoints of the intervals to partition continuous
    variables. For example, definition for `eop_size` based on
    `eop_size_mm` was given as:

| eop\_size | eop\_size\_mm |
|----------:|:--------------|
|         0 | 0-5           |
|         1 | 5-10          |
|         2 | 10-15         |
|         3 | 15-20         |
|         4 | 20-25         |
|         5 | 25+           |

But whether dividing points (5,10…) belong to the former or latter group
was not specified, which results in problems shown in the following
table, that both 15 and 20 are categorized into `eop_size` == 3 (and
also a classifications into 14.6)

``` r
eop_df %>% 
  select(eop_size_mm,eop_size) %>%
  filter(eop_size_mm %in% c(15,20)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| eop\_size\_mm | eop\_size |
|--------------:|:----------|
|            15 | 3         |
|            15 | 3         |
|            20 | 3         |
|            20 | 3         |
|            15 | 14.6      |

2.  Categorical variables in the dataset didn’t correctly implement the
    definitions given. Some discordence between the *given categorical
    groups* and *recalculated groups* are shown in the following tables:

``` r
eop_df %>% 
  select(age,age_group) %>%
  mutate(
         age_group_recalculate = case_when(
          age <= 17 ~ "1",
          (age > 17) & (age <= 30) ~ "2",
          (age > 30) & (age <= 40) ~ "3",
          (age > 40) & (age <= 50) ~ "4",
          (age > 50) & (age <= 60) ~ "5",
          (age > 60) & (age <= 70) ~ "6",
          (age > 70) & (age <= 80) ~ "7",
           age > 80 ~ "8")) %>% 
  filter(!(age_group == age_group_recalculate)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| age | age\_group | age\_group\_recalculate |

    and sex groups with violin plot,including major statistics quartiles
    and means. *Figure 4 (Improved)* shows the rate of EEOP across age
    and sex groups with a scatter plot.

2.  From the paper, the threshold for recording the size of an EOP was
    set at 5 mm, so here we filtered samples with `eop_size_mm` &lt;=
    5mm. From the resulting scater plot, no clear trend is seen either
    accross `age` and `sex` groups, or between `eop_size_mm` and
    `fhp_size_mm`, so EOP size may not be associated with FHP size,
    gender or age.

``` r
eop_df %>% 
  select(age,sex,eop_size_mm,fhp_size_mm) %>% 
  filter(eop_size_mm >= 5) %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  filter(age >= 18) %>% 
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age <= 30 ~ "2",
      (age > 30) &(age <= 40) ~ "3",
      (age > 40) &(age <= 50) ~ "4",
      (age > 50) &(age <= 60) ~ "5",
      (age > 60)~ "6"),
    age_group = factor(age_group, levels = c("2","3","4","5","6"),ordered = TRUE, 
                       labels = c("18-30 years","30s","40s","50s",">60")),
    eop_size = case_when(
      eop_size_mm <= 5 ~ 0,

### 3 - Reproducing reported results

Comparing the authors’ stated sample sizes in each age group and what we
calculated from data, the sample sizes are, though similar, not
identical except for `50s` groups.

``` r
sample_size_available = eop_df %>% 
  filter(age >= 18) %>% 
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age <= 30 ~ "2",
      (age > 30) &(age <= 40) ~ "3",
      (age > 40) &(age <= 50) ~ "4",
      (age > 50) &(age <= 60) ~ "5",
      (age > 60)~ "6"),
    age_group = factor(age_group, levels = c("2","3","4","5","6"),ordered = TRUE, 
                       labels = c("18-30 years","30s","40s","50s",">60"))) %>% 
  group_by(age_group) %>% 
  summarize(size = n())

tibble(
  age_group = c("18-30 years","30s","40s","50s",">60"),
  from_paper = c(300,200,200,200,300),
  from_data = pull(sample_size_available,size)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

From the paper, mean FHP for male was 28 ±15 mm, for female 24 ±11 mm;

from the data, mean FHP for male was 28.8±14.7mm, for female
23.7±10.6mm,

which are identical after rounding.

``` r
eop_df %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(fhp_mean = mean(fhp_size_mm,na.rm = TRUE),
            fhp_sd = sd(fhp_size_mm,na.rm = TRUE))
```

Definition of EEOP: EOP with size exceeded 10 mm, namely
`eop_size_mm`&gt; 10 or `eop_size` &gt; 1. Since internal inconsistency
existed in encoding `eop_size` from `eop_size_mm`, we can validate the
prevalence of EEOP using criteria `eop_size_mm`&gt; 10 directly. The
calculated prevalence is 32.1%, still similar but not identical to that
reported (33%) in the paper.

``` r
eeop_recalculated = eop_df %>% 
  mutate(
    eeop = case_when(eop_size_mm > 10 ~ 1,
                     eop_size_mm <= 10 ~ 0))
sum(pull(eeop_recalculated,eeop))/dim(eeop_recalculated)[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.3210483

From the following plot, proportion of FHP &gt;40 mm subjects increases
with age, and the proportion within `>60` age group is 32.5%, different
but close to 34.5% given in the paper. The results does show that FHP
&gt;40mm may be more common in older subjects.

``` r
eop_df %>% 
  filter(fhp_size_mm >40) %>% 
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age <= 30 ~ "2",
      (age > 30) &(age <= 40) ~ "3",
      (age > 40) &(age <= 50) ~ "4",
      (age > 50) &(age <= 60) ~ "5",
      (age > 60)~ "6"),
    age_group = factor(age_group, levels = c("2","3","4","5","6"),ordered = TRUE, 
                       labels = c("18-30 years","30s","40s","50s",">60"))) %>% 
  group_by(age_group) %>% 
  summarize(case = n()) %>% 
  left_join(sample_size_available) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = round(case/size,3))%>%   

  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = proportion))+
